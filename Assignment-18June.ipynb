    "A. The logging and print statements in Python serve different purposes and have distinct use cases in a real-world appl.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Purpose:\n",
    "print: The print statement is used for basic output and is commonly used for debugging and quick inspection of variables\n",
    "    or intermediate values during development. It writes the output to the standard output (usually the console), making it suitable for simple troubleshooting during code development.\n",
    "logging: The logging module is a more sophisticated and powerful mechanism for logging information during the execution of\n",
    "    a program. It allows you to categorize log messages by severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL),\n",
    "    format log messages, manage log handlers (e.g., writing logs to a file, sending over a network), and control logging\n",
    "    behavior at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Control and Flexibility:\n",
    "print: The print statement is straightforward and easy to use, but it lacks the ability to control the level of detail or\n",
    "    the severity of the output. Once the code is deployed, removing or commenting out print statements can be tedious, and they might inadvertently remain in the codebase, cluttering the output.\n",
    "logging: The logging module provides fine-grained control over the log messages. You can enable or disable logging for \n",
    "    specific modules, set different log levels, and configure different log handlers, all without modifying the code.\n",
    "    This flexibility allows you to control the verbosity of the log output, making it suitable for both development and \n",
    "    production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Logging Best Practices:\n",
    "print: While print statements are easy to implement and may be useful for quick debugging, they are generally not suitable\n",
    "    for production code. Leaving print statements in a production application can lead to security risks, performance \n",
    "    degradation, and an unprofessional user experience.\n",
    "logging: Using the logging module is a best practice for production code. It allows you to log important events, errors,\n",
    "    and warnings, which can be invaluable for debugging and monitoring the application. By configuring logging properly,\n",
    "    you can ensure that only relevant information is logged, and you can enable more detailed logging when needed during \n",
    "    troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Output Destination:\n",
    "print: The print statement outputs to the standard output (console) by default, and its output cannot be easily redirected \n",
    "    to other destinations, such as log files or remote log servers.\n",
    "logging: The logging module provides handlers that can send log messages to various destinations, such as files, email,\n",
    "    syslog, and network servers. This makes it more suitable for logging in a variety of production scenarios, allowing \n",
    "    you to capture and analyze log data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use print statements during development for quick inspection and debugging purposes. However, in real-world \n",
    "    applications, use the logging module for structured and controlled logging. Logging provides greater flexibility,\n",
    "    configurability, and security, making it a better choice for capturing important information and events throughout\n",
    "    the applications lifecycle. Properly configured logging helps developers understand the applications behavior, \n",
    "    diagnose issues, and monitor performance in a systematic and professional manner."
